# Tasks

> **Hint**: CSS is not the topic here. The priority should be completing as many tasks as you can, even if it means your app looks like crap.

#### 1. Create ProductListComponent that displays a list of products

#### 2. Create Product component which will receive product as props

#### 3. Create Cart component (empty for now)

#### 4. :star: Create button that will toggle the description of product

> **Hint**: you can use [mocky.io](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5db94dfe30000075005ee18a/?mocky-delay=2000ms) for Product data - just copy it over to your code.
