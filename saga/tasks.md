# Tasks

#### 1. Create saga for fetching data from `http://www.mocky.io/v2/5db94dfe30000075005ee18a/?mocky-delay=2000ms` and save it in store and show in ProductList

#### 2. :star: Show loading text before data is fetched

#### 3. :fire: Handle errors with saga and display error message in component if fetching data caused error

> **Hint**: It's okay to get stuck. If you do, first check your terminal for TypeScript errors and if there are any, try solving them starting with the top one.
> If that doesn't work then ask your mate or look for a mentor.

> **Hint**: Some tasks are marked as **optional** using the :star: emoji - those are extra tasks that are usually a little bit harder. It's great if you manage to complete them, but they are not necessary for next modules.

#### 1. Add types to the code from the "It's just javascript" section

> You'll find the code [here](https://codesandbox.io/embed/typescript-vs-javascript-n8ci4), either edit it inline or copy it over to your editor.
