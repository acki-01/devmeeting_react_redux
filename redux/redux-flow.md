Redux is a state management system based on [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). Basically it means
 that the data flows only in one direction. Main concept behind Redux are:

-   One global store
-   Immutability of data
-   Separation of concerns (actions, reducers, store)

To start working with Redux You need to install some additional packages:

`npm install --save redux react-redux`
